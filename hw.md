Homework #1 Dr. King's "I Have A Dream" Speech It's August of 1963 and you've agreed to help Dr. King prepare his "I have a dream" speech. You will be using Git to store versions of his speech as he develops it.  Dr. King will produce the paragraphs that he wants to include in his speech. You will then add them tothe git staging area as they become available. When he's happy with what he has created, you will thencommit them to git's history. As with all such speeches, Dr. King may choose to change his mind as time moves on and he'll probably make changes to what he has already written. When he does this it is going to be up to you to add themto the git staging area and then commit them once again. Your goal in the end is going to be to provide Dr. King with the speech that he wants to deliver. When you are done making all of the changes that Dr. King has asked for, you will turn in the final text of the speech in a single file. You will also turn in a properly formatted record of the git log at the end of the speech creation process. Input Your input for this assignment will be a series of files titled "P1.txt" through "P6.txt". Each of these files will contain one paragraph of Dr. King's speech as he writes it.
